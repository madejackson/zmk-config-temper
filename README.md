Based on [temper](https://github.com/raeedcho/temper) that itself is a great continuation of [chocofi](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi/).

## Hardware

## Firmware
I use a Nice Nano v2 so I can be wireless. This means that I use zmk instead of qmk. Luckily zmk.studio got recently released, so we can change our keymaps on the fly. The firmware will be created in an github action and you can use zmk.studio.
